long-description: This is the network of connections between autonomous systems of the Internet. The nodes are autonomous systems (AS), i.e. collections of connected IP routing prefixes controlled by independent network operators. Edges are connections between autonomous systems. Multiple edges may connect two nodes, each representing an individual connection in time. Edges are annotated with the timepoint of the connection.
