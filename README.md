# Networks_AI_Live_Training

## Overview

Networks, also known as graphs are one of the most crucial data structures in our increasingly intertwined world. Social friendship networks, the world-wide-web, financial systems, infrastructure (power grid, streets), etc. are all network structures. Knowing how to analyze the underlying network topology of interconnected systems can provide an invaluable skill in anyone's toolbox. This tutorial will provide a hands-on guide on how to approach a network analysis project from scratch and end-to-end: how to generate, manipulate, analyze and visualize graph structures that will help you gain insight about relationships between elements in your data. You will learn how to detect communities in network to identify more densely interconnected subgroups used on social media platforms to detect social groups, and how to most effectively highlight them in a graph visualization. Analyzing a network from real data is crucial in understanding the patterns and behaviors of a real system. But often times you will need to build synthetic networks, which can serve as baseline models for your studies, or sometimes it becomes even more cost efficient to rely on synthetic networks instead of collecting large-scale data. In the last part of this course you will learn when, why and how to build synthetic networks.
